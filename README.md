         "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information",
         "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command": "Information"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*",
     "Jwt": {
       "Secret": "^N8>4}K2(1tIQC*sc(}b>)ZFC9Xk5!rymt=f5Q<k,/-NWsg%G]g7[rBtWJ3w4QZv",
       "Issuer": "SpiritX",

         "http://localhost:3000"
       ]
     },
     "GeminiAPI": {
       "Key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
     }
   }
   ```

6. Create `appsettings.Development.json` for development-specific settings:
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Debug",
         "Microsoft": "Information",
         "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information",
         "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command": "Information"
       }
     },
     "DetailedErrors": true
   }
   ```

7. Apply database migrations
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

8. Run the project
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

9. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5234`

### Frontend Requirements and Setup

1. Install Node.js (v16+) and npm
   - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

2. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```bash
   cd spiritx/spiritx-frontend
   ```

3. Install all required NPM packages:
   ```bash
   # Core React packages
   npm install react@19.0.0 react-dom@19.0.0 react-scripts@5.0.1

   # Routing
   npm install react-router-dom@7.3.0

   # UI components
   npm install bootstrap@5.3.3 react-bootstrap@2.10.9 styled-components@6.1.15

   # Icons and UI elements
   npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@0.2.2 @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons@6.7.2
   npm install react-icons@5.5.0

   # HTTP requests
   npm install axios@1.8.2

   # Real-time updates with SignalR
   npm install @microsoft/signalr@8.0.7

   # Charts and data visualization
   npm install chart.js@4.4.8 react-chartjs-2@5.3.0

   # Testing libraries

   npm install @testing-library/user-event@13.5.0 @testing-library/dom@10.4.0

   # Performance measurement
   npm install web-vitals@2.1.4
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install all dependencies at once using the package.json:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create `.env` file in the root of the frontend project:
   ```
   # API Endpoint
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5234/api

   # SignalR Hub
   REACT_APP_SIGNALR_HUB=http://localhost:5234/playerStatsHub

   # Default Budget
   REACT_APP_DEFAULT_BUDGET=9000000

   # Team Size Limit
   REACT_APP_TEAM_SIZE_LIMIT=11

   # Application Version
   REACT_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

   # Enable/Disable Debug Mode (true/false)
   REACT_APP_DEBUG=false
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## Player Points Calculation

The player points are calculated using the following formula (but never shown to users):
```
points = ((batting_strike_rate / 5) + (batting_average * 0.8)) + 
         ((500 / (bowling_strike_rate + 0.1)) + (140 / (economy_rate + 0.1)))
```

Key components of the formula:
- Batting Strike Rate = (Total Runs / Balls Faced) * 100
- Batting Average = Total Runs / Innings Played
- Bowling Strike Rate = (Overs Bowled * 6) / Wickets
- Economy Rate = Runs Conceded / Overs Bowled

For players with 0 wickets, a default bowling strike rate of 0.1 is used to avoid division by zero.
For players with 0 overs bowled, a default economy rate of 0.1 is used to avoid division by zero.

## Player Value Calculation

The player value is calculated using the following formula:
```
value = (9 * Points + 100) * 1000
```

This value is then rounded to the nearest multiple of 50,000 to get the final player value in Rupees.

## Security Measures

1. **Password Security**: 
   - Passwords are hashed using BCrypt
   - Passwords are never sent or stored in plain text

2. **JWT Security**:
   - Tokens are signed with a strong secret key
   - Token expiration is enforced
   - Tokens include only necessary claims

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs are validated on both frontend and backend
   - SQL parameters are used to prevent SQL injection

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Detailed errors are logged on the server
   - Generic error messages are returned to clients to avoid information leakage
   
5. **Data Protection**:
   - Player points are kept private and never exposed to users
   - Sensitive data is not exposed through API responses
